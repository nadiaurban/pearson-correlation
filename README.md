# Pearson Correlation in Python

This repository demonstrates how to calculate the **Pearson correlation coefficient** in Python using **Pandas** and **Scipy**. It includes a step-by-step tutorial, a synthetic dataset, and a synthetic survey to help you understand and apply Pearson correlation in data analysis.

## **Contents**
1. **Python Notebook**:
   - A Jupyter Notebook with detailed examples of calculating Pearson correlation using both Pandas and Scipy.
   - Includes explanations, code, and visualization of the results.

2. **Synthetic Dataset**:
   - A dataset created to simulate real-world survey data for practicing data analysis.
   - Variables include trust in government, social equality support, and more.

3. **Synthetic Survey**:
   - A sample survey provided for reference to understand the context and variables used in the dataset.

## **Key Features**
- **Pandas**:
  - Use the `.corr()` method to quickly calculate Pearson correlation.
  
- **Scipy**:
  - Use the `pearsonr()` function to calculate both the Pearson correlation coefficient and the p-value for statistical significance.

- **Visualization**:
  - Create scatter plots with regression lines using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to visually interpret the relationships.
